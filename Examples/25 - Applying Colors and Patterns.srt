1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,295
In this module will be taking a closer look at

2
00:00:03,367 --> 00:00:04,943
the material settings,

3
00:00:04,943 --> 00:00:09,596
which involves adding new fabrics and changing their physical properties

4
00:00:09,661 --> 00:00:11,600
as well as their outer traits.

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,847
Now we will start off with changing just the colours,

6
00:00:14,847 --> 00:00:17,131
maybe adding some patterns and so on,

7
00:00:17,131 --> 00:00:19,999
and I will demonstrate all of this to the upper

8
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:21,220
part of our outfit.

9
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,565
So these two patterns and the sleeves.

10
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:26,132
Now if we take a look at the optic browser

11
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:27,293
to the fabric tab,

12
00:00:27,293 --> 00:00:30,213
we see that we only have one default fabric that

13
00:00:30,274 --> 00:00:32,343
is applied to all of our patterns,

14
00:00:32,343 --> 00:00:36,144
so will start off by adding a new one by

15
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:37,570
clicking here.

16
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,130
And renaming it to top.

17
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:43,417
Now we're going to drag and drop this newly made

18
00:00:43,485 --> 00:00:45,060
fabric to the patterns.

19
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:48,080
So the two front ones.

20
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,840
As well as the back ones.

21
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,350
We're going to leave these strips of fabric out.

22
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:58,308
And this leaves. We're also going to check by clicking

23
00:00:58,382 --> 00:00:59,188
on the top.

24
00:00:59,188 --> 00:01:00,683
If the fabric was applied.

25
00:01:00,683 --> 00:01:03,203
As you can see, it gets an orange outline and

26
00:01:03,259 --> 00:01:05,611
we see that we've applied it successfully.

27
00:01:05,611 --> 00:01:08,152
Now let's take a look at the settings that we

28
00:01:08,209 --> 00:01:08,491
have,

29
00:01:08,491 --> 00:01:11,160
which opened up in the property editor.

30
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:14,241
First thing you'll notice is that you can make different

31
00:01:14,296 --> 00:01:15,561
textures for the front,

32
00:01:15,561 --> 00:01:17,880
back or side of the fabric an each tab has

33
00:01:17,935 --> 00:01:18,929
the same settings,

34
00:01:18,929 --> 00:01:21,531
so you can really customize this as much as you

35
00:01:21,586 --> 00:01:21,863
like,

36
00:01:21,863 --> 00:01:25,084
but will stick to changing the front side for now

37
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:25,610
though.

38
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:29,071
So of course, the obvious thing that we can change

39
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:30,732
is of course the color,

40
00:01:30,732 --> 00:01:32,235
and if I click on it,

41
00:01:32,235 --> 00:01:35,495
you see that I'm able to choose from every kind

42
00:01:35,564 --> 00:01:36,674
of color I want.

43
00:01:36,674 --> 00:01:39,741
I can even use the eyedropper tool if I need

44
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:40,089
too,

45
00:01:40,089 --> 00:01:42,684
and so on. So let's go for a very dark

46
00:01:42,753 --> 00:01:44,870
black color for now and hit OK.

47
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:51,131
Underneath the color option we have the specular color,

48
00:01:51,131 --> 00:01:54,995
which gives us a shining's effect and if I demonstrate

49
00:01:55,066 --> 00:01:55,424
this,

50
00:01:55,424 --> 00:01:58,505
if I click on it and let's go for something

51
00:01:58,577 --> 00:01:59,365
like wider,

52
00:01:59,365 --> 00:02:02,791
you can see that I get this effect that looks

53
00:02:02,868 --> 00:02:07,512
almost like leather so I can achieve very interesting effects

54
00:02:07,589 --> 00:02:08,350
with this.

55
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:12,225
And I can also adjust the shininess factor so I

56
00:02:12,307 --> 00:02:14,286
can make it very subtle,

57
00:02:14,286 --> 00:02:17,630
or I can make it very pronounced.

58
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:20,576
Depending on what kind of effect I want now,

59
00:02:20,576 --> 00:02:23,830
I can even upload a specular map to this and

60
00:02:23,904 --> 00:02:27,527
I'm just going to quickly upload a texture that I

61
00:02:27,601 --> 00:02:29,820
have by clicking on this icon.

62
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,977
And I'm going to choose this ornament image that I

63
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,050
have right here.

64
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:35,410
An if I zoom in.

65
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,807
You can see the subtle ornament within our shirt,

66
00:02:42,807 --> 00:02:47,498
and it's usually more pronounced when the light is hitting

67
00:02:47,578 --> 00:02:51,622
the fabric and hides when the fabric goes into the

68
00:02:51,703 --> 00:02:52,350
shadows.

69
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:55,531
Course I can also manipulate this as well with the

70
00:02:55,595 --> 00:02:58,713
shininess factor to make it more or less visible.

71
00:02:58,713 --> 00:03:00,670
If I would like to.

72
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,984
Next, we have the emission colour.

73
00:03:02,984 --> 00:03:07,150
The emission color is for clothing that basically emits light,

74
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:09,663
so I can easily change it right here,

75
00:03:09,663 --> 00:03:11,779
but we don't need that for now,

76
00:03:11,779 --> 00:03:15,335
so let's just cancel this and I'm also going to

77
00:03:15,411 --> 00:03:19,496
delete the specular map by pressing on this icon right

78
00:03:19,572 --> 00:03:19,950
here.

79
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,031
There's one thing that we forgot,

80
00:03:22,031 --> 00:03:24,050
and at the very top of the list,

81
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:25,457
and that is a texture,

82
00:03:25,457 --> 00:03:27,721
so we can also add our own textures.

83
00:03:27,721 --> 00:03:29,680
Maybe some that we find online,

84
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,005
or some that we've created ourselves.

85
00:03:32,005 --> 00:03:34,679
So I simply just click on this icon as with

86
00:03:34,742 --> 00:03:35,799
the specular map.

87
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:39,164
And again, I'm going to use this ornament image again,

88
00:03:39,164 --> 00:03:41,000
so just going to open that up.

89
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,827
And once I applied this texture,

90
00:03:45,827 --> 00:03:48,570
I can also put a color on top of it.

91
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:52,055
So if I choose white I get the original image.

92
00:03:52,055 --> 00:03:55,517
But I can also apply my own colors and you

93
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,320
see I get very different effects.

94
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,978
So this is very neat.

95
00:03:59,978 --> 00:04:04,649
You can really customize your textures and patterns this way,

96
00:04:04,649 --> 00:04:07,911
so I'm just gonna leave it to a bit of

97
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:09,800
an orange and hit OK.

98
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,588
Now the next thing that I would like to show

99
00:04:12,651 --> 00:04:15,693
you is how to further manipulate these patterns,

100
00:04:15,693 --> 00:04:18,595
because as you can see the pattern is so small

101
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:22,066
that it's beginning to repeat itself and maybe I would

102
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:25,599
like to resize it rotated or maybe changes its position

103
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:28,126
an I can easily do that with the help of

104
00:04:28,189 --> 00:04:31,094
the edit texture tool that can be found in the

105
00:04:31,158 --> 00:04:34,000
2D window right here or even in the 3D window

106
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,859
right here so I can edit and move the texture

107
00:04:36,922 --> 00:04:38,828
in the 3D or in the 2D window.

108
00:04:38,828 --> 00:04:43,710
It doesn't even matter. So if I zoom in.

109
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:46,698
If I click on the pattern you see that I

110
00:04:46,773 --> 00:04:50,284
get this handle right here and I'm able to move

111
00:04:50,359 --> 00:04:51,330
the patterns.

112
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:53,200
In any way that I would like.

113
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:58,914
In the upper right corner I'm also able to rotate

114
00:04:58,990 --> 00:04:59,970
the patterns.

115
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:03,240
An I can also resize them.

116
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,610
Or maybe just the Y or the X axis.

117
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:11,460
You can also apply these changes under texture transformation.

118
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:15,200
That can be found under the property editor.

119
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,835
So right below the emission color we have the texture

120
00:05:18,904 --> 00:05:19,933
transformation.

121
00:05:19,933 --> 00:05:23,070
So if you would like to move rotate or.

122
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,076
Anything else by an exact number,

123
00:05:25,076 --> 00:05:28,642
you can just input that here so you don't need

124
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,270
to do here manually.

125
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:34,637
And then the next option that we have is the

126
00:05:34,736 --> 00:05:35,530
Opacity.

127
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:38,530
If I lower it, I get a see through material.

128
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:42,887
So we took a look.

129
00:05:42,887 --> 00:05:47,190
This is basically all of the settings that involve sort

130
00:05:47,269 --> 00:05:50,320
of the outer appearance of our texture.

131
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,214
And the next important tap that we have is the

132
00:05:53,277 --> 00:05:57,303
physical property which involves the property of the fabric that

133
00:05:57,366 --> 00:06:00,385
we have an we're going to tackle this further in

134
00:06:00,385 --> 00:06:01,883
the next clip.
